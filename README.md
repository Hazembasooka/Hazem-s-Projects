#The first-ich project
This was my first personal project apart from the ones that I made during my studies.
This is a Library Mangment system, I chose this project as a way to apply my learning of Object Orianted Programming(OOP).
This version has not been Optimised as the project descibtion was pretty unclear,but during the next period I will be working on improving its preformece and working
on other projects.
